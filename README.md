# Area Calculator - C++ Console Application

This is a basic C++ program that calculates the area of different geometric shapes (square, rectangle, triangle, and circle) based on user input.  
It was implemented as a final exercise during a C++ programming course I took at the Syrian Scientific Society for Informatics in early 2020.

## ðŸ”§ Features
- Uses conditional statements
- Handles user input with validation
- Supports 4 geometric shapes

## ðŸ“„ Technologies
- Language: C++
- IDE: Code::Blocks / VS Code (any C++ compiler)

## ðŸ“¥ How to Run
1. Copy the code into your C++ IDE
2. Compile and run
